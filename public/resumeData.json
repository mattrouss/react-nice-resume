        "description": "During my 4 years of studies at EPITA, I was able to develop my skills as a developer and as an engineer. I have become a proficient programmer mostly in Python and C++, with a little bit of OpenGL and web programming as well. Many of my class projects were performed as a group, and I have learned to work as an active role and as leader in such projects. During my final years of the cursus, I have specialized in the \"IMAGE\" major, whose teachings include image analysis, machine learning and computer graphics."

My first task during this internship was to add features to Odin Vision's annotation tool, where I was able to discuss with medical clinicians an effective annotation process. During the largest part of my internship, I worked on an internal tool whose objective was to run containerized machine learning algorithms on any type of data in a scheduled manner, deployed on the cloud using Kubernetes and Apache Airflow. This tool provides an automation in retraining machine learning and deep learning models, once new annotated data is acquired."
